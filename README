A stand alone class that fires an event at a particular interval. This frees the user from having to know about timer, events, and delegates. Also, you can pass arguments each time the timer is fired.

Include this namespace in your project and follow the instructions below:

-----instantiate 
TimedEvent event = new TimedEvent(int timeDelay, int fireInterval, object parameters)

-----enable firing events 
event.eventTrigger += new TimedEvent.fireEvent(methodToBeCalledWhenTimerFired);

public void methodToBeCalledWhenTimerFired(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
  //Do something 
  //Note the method signature...the method and delegate (fireEvent) signature MUST match
  //"object sender" can be used to pass any sort of information
}

-----stop timer
event.disposeTimer();
